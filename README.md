## Banker Roullete - Who's Paying App

# Instructions

I wrote a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

**Important**: I didn't use `choice()` , otherwise, it would be too easy.

**Line 8** splitted the string `names_string` into individual names and puts them inside a **List** called `names`. For this to work, the user must enter all names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

# Example Input

```
Joey, Ross, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe
```

Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

# Example Output

```
Rachel is going to buy the meal today!
```

# What I've used?

1. I need the help of the `len()` function.

2. Kept in mind that that lists start at index 0!
